Synopsis:
Our project tackled the challenge of picking the best students for universities. We used tools to quickly sort and understand a lot of student information like grades and test scores. This makes it easier for universities to choose the right students. We tested the tools to make sure they work well and found they're really fast and efficient due to the implementation of data structures like hash tables and BST. We also talked about ways to make them even better in the future. 
Our project showed how using computers can help universities make smarter choices about who to admit.
